# coreProject

A project that I am currently working on right now. A friend of mine wanted to create an application that allows users to rate and review music, videogames, movies, and other entertainmentplatforms.

He presented me this idea and asked if I could create it. 

Already finished the Back End and the Login/Signup.

Currently finishing up the Welcome Page for individuals that are not signed in, they will be able to see the Top Songs and Playlist provided by the Spotify API and Videogames that have been reviewed by "Feature Reviewers"

Next thing that needs to be worked on are the different pages users will be able to see and interact with depending if they are signed in or not. Want to start creating the pages that allow the user (when signed in) to write reviews for any entrainment platforms.

This is a work in progress and I am dedicating about 35 hours a week to this project. Really excited for it and want to finish it by the end of February at least.
