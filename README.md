Hey guys,
So I have been creating a web application with the help of my friend Corey. After almost two months of work, I am ready to finally show it off and get some user feedback. Love for you guys to try it out and just give me your honest opinons. I want to see what I can do to enhance the user's experince. By no means do you have to "try to break it" or "test it". I just want you guys to use it the way you want and think it should be used and let me know what you think.

If you do run into errors, please let me know. I think if there are any errors, it should send you back to the home page but not 100% sure. If there is an error or even a function of the application that confuses you, annoys you or ruins your experince, please let me know.

As of now, the application is work and most of the UI is passable; however, as you guys are playing with it, I will be reaching out to some UI experts and get some design and User Interface advice and will be updating it. The two pages that are horrendous are the arena page, profile page, and results page. Going to do a lot of remodeling with those pages; hwoever, for now, I believe they work and get the job done.

The application is called Pantheon:
	Pantheon is a web application that allows User's to choose any song in the Spotify Library and compete with them. User's can create tournaments or Pantheons and invite their friends. Once the Pantheon has been created, user's will choose songs they think best represents the category for the Pantheon. Users will vote on what they think is the best songs and choose the winners of the rounds and ultimately, the finals.

Limitations of the application as of now: 
	Pantheons only accept a number of 4 users for tournaments. I understand that this basically creates ton of issues with voting because often times there will be ties. I created it that if in fact there is a tie, the winner will be chosen randomly. As I have said with the UI, I will be createing a 8 man tournament to make voting not so awkward. 

	
Goals of the application:
	Get user feedback for the next two weeks to a month,
	Build an 8 man tournament setting,
	Finish the UI and design of the website

List of people I will send the application out. I am doing this so that way users will have plenty of options to create Pantheons with, the application has a friend list; however, it uses usernames to connect with friends. Will be keeping a list of the user and their usernames so that way everyone can hopefully be friends with each other and get multiple Pantheons going:


	Robby :

	David:

	Kristen:

	Jake Sandberg:

	David Lasezkay:

	Jacob Borno:

	Jane:

	Jenny:

	Kim:

	Scott:

	Sean:

	Elaine:

	Josh Shier:

	Cayman:

	Grayson:

	Christian:

	Anne:

    Corey: 

	Discord: {

	}

	
Will be updating this frequently so that way people can see each others username and if there are more people I have invited.

Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to help me out. Super excitied for this and cant wait to get feedback.
